PolyDefense
===========
PolyDefense is no ordinary tower-defense game. The enemies are devious red triangles whose only goal is to destroy you and your HQ. You have the advantage though! Your ability to redirect their paths and to build a strategic base puts you in the lead. Beware though: the enemies have strength in numbers and will endure against all odds. To help with your crusade, guns and towers, defensive and offensive, are at your disposal. This battle may never end, but how long can you survive?

With each new round, an increasing amount of zombified red triangles will spawn. The objective of the game is to keep your HQ alive. When itâ€™s health runs down to zero, it is game over. Towers, walls, and guns can be purchased using points gained from destroying evil triangles. Points are a scarce but crucial to your survival. More points can be gained from exploring the darker regions of the map and mining from point wells.
