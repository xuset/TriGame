#### A little more info
With each new round, an increasing amount of zombies (red triangles) will spawn. They will try to attack you, your towers, and HQ. The objective of the game is to keep your HQ alive. When it's health runs down to zero, it is game over. Once it looses health, there is no getting it back. If your player looses health, he can replenish it by picking up a health pack. The game is not over if your player dies, he will just respawn the next round assuming your HQ survives. You can get points by killing the zombies, picking up point packs, and mining from point wells. These points can be used to buy towers, guns, and upgrades for both.

Multiple people can join and play the same game as well. There is no limit to the max amount of players. The game has been tested with up to seven players and worked fine. To connect to someone who is not on your network, you will have to port forward and use external ip addresses. However if they are on the same network, setup is easy.
